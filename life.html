					<p>Seas scouts showed me the beauty of adventure. One of my fondest memories is an event called Gig adventure. Gig adventure is a 45km - 28 mile journey, in which you row the gig (that big boat in the picture) along the Vaal river. The oldest person in the boat at the time was 14 years old, and we were given only a map. The event starts 12:01 am Saturday morning and you have until Sunday 11:59 pm to finish. I took part in this event 3 times and each time we had equally interesting stories. From finding refuge with drunk fishermen at 4 in the morning to playing pirates of the Caribbean theme music as we passed people enjoying the river, and even being shot at by farmers who thought we were invading their land.</p>

					<p>Sport has taught me so many things about myself and how to work together with people. It prepared me to deal with disappointment, nerves and how to work harder than anyone else to get what I want. In my final year of high school, I managed to make the U18B  South Africa National Side. Unfortunately, men's field hockey in South Africa does not have much funding and many of the professional field hockey players have to support themselves. For this reason, I took up another big passion of mine and did my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering.</p>

					<p>A group of my friends and I went to an Animal Rescue center in  Reitz  South Africa. The Husky Romi Rescue and Wolf Sanctuary provides a safe haven for abandoned and abused huskies and wolves in South Africa. One of the most significant problems the Rescue center has is that during the summer months the wolves and huskies overheat. To solve this, we spent a couple of days camping in the cold at night and building a dam for the wolves during the day. Our entire team was almost entirely computer engineers, and we had great fun figuring out how to make cement, lay bricks, plaster walls, and waterproof structures. Working inside cages with wild wolves also gave me so much respect for wild animals. The intelligence, the patience, and the pack dynamics were incredible to witness. It's sad to think at some point they were kept by humans and abused or abandoned. I hope this project keeps going and making such a massive difference to these animals lives and animals which need help.</p>

					<p>The highest peak in Africa. My dad always loved climbing and took me on several trips to the Drakensberg, a mountain range in South Africa. In 2016 during my third year of undergrad, a friend and I flew to Tanzania to take on the task. We decided to take five days (three days shorter than normal), and one of the most challenging routes up to save money. It rained the entire way up, however rising through the cloud on summit day to watch the sunset changed how I viewed the world forever.</p>

					<p>The first race dates back to 1921 when Comrades contestants ran to honor South African soldiers killed during WWI. Vic Clapham, the founder of the Comrades, wanted the race to be a be a unique test of physical and mental endurance. The constitution of the race states that one of its primary aims is to "celebrate mankind's spirit over adversity". </p>

					<p>Runners over the age of 20 qualify when they can complete an officially recognized marathon (42.2 km - 26.2 mile) in under five hours. During the event (an 87km run 1.7km - 1.05 mile altitude change), an athlete must also reach five cut-off points in specified times to complete the race. The spirit of the Comrades Marathon is said to be embodied by attributes of camaraderie, selflessness, dedication, perseverance, and ubuntu (Nguni for: "a person is a person through other persons").</p>
									   
					<p>11 hours after starting the race I crossed the finish line with a different understanding of what we as humans are capable of.</p>

The race takes runners from the Indian Ocean all the way to the Atlantic through some of the most beautiful places in Cape Town, South Africa.

					<p>Exactly one week after completing the Comrade's Marathon. Feeling unstoppable I decided to try my luck with a half Ironman. I didn't have a bike or a wetsuit, but how bad could it be? Ironman 70.3 is a  1.9km - 1.2mile swim, 90km - 56 mile bike ride, and a 21.2km - 13.1 mile run. I always find it interesting that after thinking I know my limits I push right through them. This fact is not unique to me; it's in all of us. Don't limit what you are capable of; because you are much more capable then you will ever know!</p>

					<p>Travelling has always been a passion of mine. Traveling not only reminds you how beautiful our world is but of how beautiful different people and cultures can be. With that said, a friend and I decided that we wanted to travel through southern Africa. We got a 4x4, a satellite phone with 15 minutes call time, four large paper maps. I had just been accepted to study to the USA and thus had time on my hand while I waited for the semester to start. We had no plans, or bookings or destination. It was an incredible journey which took just over a month. We drove 7000 km - 4350 miles and made tons of memories and learn lessons and more importantly remembered what is important in life.</p>
